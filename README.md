# Practice

![Practice Theme Demo](https://github.com/Dennis-Mayk/Practice/blob/master/Practice.png)
A clean timeline theme for the Ghost CMS.
This theme has been build from the ground up with a focus on only the most essential elements to keep the user experience smooth and fast.
See it in action on my private blog <a href="https://tilligetthere.com" target="_blank">'till I get there</a>.

##Installation
Just download an instance of <b>Practice</b> to your ghost's theme folder (you eventually will need to restart ghost).

##Build for Speed and User Experience
I have designed this theme with as little resources as possible to make it load faster but without compromising on user experience.
######Google PageSpeed results [(Check it out)](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftilligetthere.com%2F&tab=mobile):
<ul>
<li>Mobile: Speed 99/100</li>
<li>Mobile: User Experience 100/100</li>
<li>Desktop: Speed 99/100</li>
</ul>

##Improvements
I will continue working on <b>Practice</b> to increase performance and keep it up to date with newer Ghost versions.
