# Practice

![Practice Theme Demo](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/74653178/Practice%20.png)

A clean timeline theme for the Ghost CMS.
This theme has been build from the ground up with a focus on only the most essential elements to keep the user experience smooth and fast.
See it in action on my private blog ['till I get there](https://tilligetthere.com).

##Installation
Just download an instance of <b>Practice</b> to your ghost's theme folder (you eventually will need to restart ghost).

##Improvements
I will continue working on <b>Practice</b> to increase performance and keep it up to date with newer Ghost versions.
If you feel like you want to contribute feel free to drop me a message.
